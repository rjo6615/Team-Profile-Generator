# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

While learning web development it is important to understand and utalize classes and object oriented programming(OOP).
This project allowed me to display my skills in OOP through the creation of a Team Profile Generator where
a user is prompted with various questions then a HTML file is generated in proper format.
